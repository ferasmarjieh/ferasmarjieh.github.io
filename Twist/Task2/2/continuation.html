    <h1>Little Red Riding Hood</h1>
    <p>
        As she walked through the forest, Little Red Riding Hood met a wolf. The wolf asked her where she was going.
    </p>
    <p>
        She hesitated, but then she said, "I’m going to visit my grandmother, who lives at the edge of the forest."
    </p>
    <p>
        "Oh, what a lovely little girl you are," said the wolf. "Why don’t you pick some flowers for your grandmother?" Little Red Riding Hood thought it was a good idea and started to pick flowers.
