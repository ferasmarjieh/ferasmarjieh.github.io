    <h1>Little Red Riding Hood</h1>
    <p>
        Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved to wear a red hooded cape that her grandmother had given her. Everyone in the village called her "Little Red Riding Hood."
        One day, her mother asked her to take some food to her sick grandmother who lived at the edge of the forest.

    <p>
        "Don’t talk to strangers along the way," her mother warned. Little Red Riding Hood promised to obey and set off down the path.
